# VoltUnity - Unified EV Charging Platform

## a) Project Abstract  
**VoltUnity** is a medium-scale microservice platform that unifies discovery, booking, charging and payment of electric-vehicle (EV) stations across multiple operators. Drivers can search and reserve charging slots in real time, unlock chargers from their phone, view consumption and CO₂-savings dashboards, and choose between pay-per-use or subscription plans. Operators get tools to register and manage stations, monitor usage trends and export reports. A public API and sandbox enable third-party integrations.
